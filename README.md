## Abstract

> We explore the use of inverse design methods for generation of periodic optical patterns in photonic
> integrated circuits. A carefully selected objective function based on the integer lattice method, which
> is an algebraic technique for optical lattice generation, is shown to be key for successful device design.
> Furthermore, we present a polychromatic pattern generating device that switches between optical
> lattices with different symmetry and periodicity depending on the operating wavelength. Important
> links are drawn between optical coherent lattices and optical potentials, pointing towards practical
> applications in the fields of quantum simulations and computing, optical trapping, and bio-sensing.

## Software implementation

The source code used to generate the optical lattices in the paper are in the jupyter notebook (can be viewed directly on GitHub).
